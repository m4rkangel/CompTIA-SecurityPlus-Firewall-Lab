# CompTIA Security+ Lab: Configuring Firewall Rules

## Scenario Overview
As a member of the Structureality Inc. security team, you are responsible for improving your organization's internal security posture. In this lab, youâ€™ll manage Windows Firewall rules to control communication between internal systems.

Youâ€™ll first test baseline connectivity (ICMP ping) between systems, then implement firewall rules to block ping responses and later restrict access to file shares.

---

## Lab Environment
- **PC10**: Windows Server 2019 (client)
- **DC10**: Windows Server 2019 (domain controller / file server)

### Tools Used
- Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security  
- Command Prompt (ping, net use)  
- CompTIA Labs virtual environment  

---

## Objectives
This lab aligns with the following **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** objectives:

- **2.5:** Explain the purpose of mitigation techniques used to secure the enterprise.  
- **4.5:** Given a scenario, modify enterprise capabilities to enhance security.  

---

## Steps Overview

### 1. Verify Initial Connectivity
- From **PC10**, test ICMP (ping) to **DC10**.  
- Confirm successful communication before rule changes.

### 2. Create Firewall Rule to Block ICMP
- Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**.  
- Add an **Inbound Rule** to **block ICMPv4 Echo Requests** on DC10.  
- Retest connectivity from PC10.

### 3. Test File Share Access
- From **PC10**, connect to a shared folder on **DC10** using:
  ```bash
  net use \\DC10\Share
  ```
- Confirm successful access.

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot 4:** File share opened successfully (before blocking rule)

---

### 4. Block File Share Access
- On **DC10**, create a new **Inbound Rule** to **block SMB traffic (TCP ports 445, 139)**.  
- Retest access from **PC10**.

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot 5:** Firewall rule properties (SMB block rule)

**ðŸ“¸ Screenshot 6:** Access denied / network path not found message (after blocking rule)

### 5. Summarize Results

| Test | Before | After |
|------|---------|--------|
| **ICMP (Ping)** | Successful | Blocked |
| **File Share Access** | Successful | Blocked |

## Analysis & Key Takeaways
- **Mitigation techniques** such as restricting ICMP and SMB help reduce attack surfaces.  
- **Firewall rules** can enforce least privilege communication policies within an enterprise network.  
- Blocking unnecessary services (like SMB or ICMP) reduces lateral movement risk.
